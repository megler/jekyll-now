### Who Am I?

I am a front end web dev seeking FT employment on-site or remote. A Dean's List student at the Harvard Extension School, I am seeking a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As an Army veteran, my superpowers are the ability to get work done and communicate well with clients, leadership, and the team.
