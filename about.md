### Who Am I?

I am a front end web dev seeking FT employment on-site or remote. A Dean's List student at the Harvard Extension School, I am seeking a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. As an Army veteran, my superpowers are the ability to get work done and communicate well with clients, leadership, and the team.

### Fun Things About Me

- CSS is my jam.  Frameworks are nice, but given the chance, I prefer to code my own styles.  Fewer divs, fewer classes, cleaner code.

- I have 3 dogs and 3 cats (gotta keep things even!).  Don't ask or you'll get pics.  Lots and lots of pics.

- My team won the grand prize at SheHacks Boston 2018.  Check out the PuppyTime repo here: [GitHub](https://github.com/megler/PuppyTime) or [Demo](https://megler.github.io/PuppyTime/)

- I took over and doubled the size of [Front End Orlando](https://www.meetup.com/Front-End-Orlando/) (500-1k) in 2016.

- I volunteer for a no-kill dog rescue as their site admin (site design not mine!) and fundraiser.  To date, I have helped them raise over $100k with email and other online campaigns.
