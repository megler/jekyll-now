title: A Study In Randomness Pt 1
---

Today we're going to do a small study in random event generation using jQuery.

I'll also show you how to do this with vanilla Javascript because while using a library like jQuery is handy, you'll find it's good to know how to do it the "hard" way - even though "hard" is relative here.


A key point before we get started.  This is not a deep dive into the philosophical underpinnings of randomness and Computer Science.  This is how to take an HTML element, in this case a div, and make it do random things.
