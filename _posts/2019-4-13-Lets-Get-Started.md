title: Let's Get Started!
---

Hey there!  Thanks for swinging by.  I am starting this blog to accomplish a few things:

1.  Have a central place to document things I learn so I can find them again.
2.  Hopefully help others pick up a few tricks for their own projects.
3.  Utilize Git and Github more regularly.
4.  Have a better shot of completing 100 days of code. #100DaysOfCode

I could have done this same blog in WordPress, but I felt like that was a lot of overhead for such a simple blog.  I run a number of WordPress sites, so if you need to see a sample of my work, just let me know.

## What To Expect

I find learning to code is best done in increments.  Get a small block to work, then iterate to the next step.  Test again.  Iterate.  

Posts on this blog will be set up in a similar fashion.  Instead of ginormous posts that show how to build an entire app, I'll take it step by step.  That helps me relocate how I did something in a particular framework and also keeps things short and sweet.

Let's see how that works out.  :wink:
